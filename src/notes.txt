Infinite loop in SearchElem during base element condition.
    is displaywidget called Infinitly?
        put breakpoint in displaywidget
        put comment
    no it's not. it's called normally at first and then loop happens in SearchElem

    is problem in how SearchElem is called in and element condition?
        return statement in SearchElem returns correct number of times, many displaywidgets

    got rid of if statement in useEffect, seems to work

And object algo:
    Forgo last base element, iterate over or and base elements and give each base element it's own key

    Get number of base elements, fill retArr with connectors.

    split:
        Iterate over base elements, reduce or elements to bases, once split index is
        reached take or element and use it's addAnd function

Todo: make right positions a global variable. in search bar element, count number of
base elements and create new refs that forward to SearchElems.
